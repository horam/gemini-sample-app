# gemini_sample_app
This project demonstrates a prototype to investigate the capabilities of Google's Generative AI models to build AI-powered applications.
This project can be a good starting point for anyone interested in participating in Google’s AI [competition](https://ai.google.dev/competition#how-to-join).

Whether you are looking to test the waters of this competition or want to explore what is possible with the Gemini API, this app can be a helpful resource, especially for those who have not started yet.
This app also showcases the Flutter [BLoC](https://github.com/felangel/bloc/tree/master) pattern implementation.

# Getting started
Using the Google AI Dart SDK requires an API key.
see https://ai.google.dev/tutorials/setup for how to create one.



## Setup environment

create `.env` file under your folder structure and put your key in it:

```
API_KEY='Your_api_key'
```

Now enjoy testing the Google's Generative AI models with this app.
